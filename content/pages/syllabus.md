Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

[_18.06 Linear Algebra_](/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/pages/index.htm) or [_18.701 Algebra I_](/courses/18-701-algebra-i-fall-2010/pages/index.htm).

Description
-----------

This course is an advanced interdisciplinary introduction to applied parallel computing on modern supercomputers. It has a hands-on emphasis on understanding the realities and myths of what is possible on the world's fastest machines.

Numerical topics include: dense and sparse linear algebra, N-body problems, multigrid, fast-multipole, wavelets and Fourier transforms. Geometrical topics include partitioning and mesh generation. Other topics include: applications oriented architecture, understanding parallel programming paradigms, MPI, data parallel systems, Star-P for parallel Python and parallel MATLABÂ®, graphics processors, virtualization, caches and vector processors.

One emphasis for this course will be VHLLs or Very High Level Languages for parallel computing. This includes the [Julia programming language](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia). Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library.

Readings
--------

There is no textbook for this course. A list of links to suggested readings and videos can be found in the [related resources]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/related-resources) section.

Requirements
------------

There will be two homework assignments and one project that will take roughly one half of the semester. You will need to hand in progress reports, a midterm, and make final presentation. The midterm is to report on your progress and is an opportunity for real feedback. The final project can be presented at the end.
